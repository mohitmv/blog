Hi, I'm Mohit. I have worked on Embedded Systems, OS kernels, thread
scheduling algorithms in OS, micro controller with RISC-V architecture, Performance optimization at the level of nano seconds, C compiler for custom hardware targets, Build performance optimization.

I've been writing C++ for 10+ years now. More than writing, I like
 deleting code. Overall I have deleted 2x amount of C++ code
than what I have written in my life.


#### Some of my best work are:


1. [CTwik](https://mohitmv.github.io/blog/CTwik-General-Purpose-Hot-Patcher-For-Cpp) - General Purpose Hot Patcher in a C++ process
2. [AParse](https://github.com/mohitmv/aparse) - General purpose parser generator (More powerful than Antlr/Bison)
3. [Quick](https://github.com/mohitmv/quick) - Collection of highly usable C++ libraries
4. [lazy_map](https://github.com/mohitmv/lazy_map) - std::unordered_map like interface but O(1) cost of copying
5. [byte_stream](https://github.com/mohitmv/byte_stream) - Super intuitive, safe, reliable and easy to use utility for binary serialisation and deserialization of complex and deeply nested C++ objects.
